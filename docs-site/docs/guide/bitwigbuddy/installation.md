## Verifying Installation

After installation:

1. A BitwigBuddy panel should be available in Bitwig Studio
   - Check for the BitwigBuddy panel in the main interface of Bitwig Studio.
2. You'll see the Generate/Edit/Macro mode selector
   - Ensure that the mode selector is visible and functional.
3. The preset browser should display all available patterns
   - Open the preset browser to confirm that all patterns are loaded correctly.

If you don't see the panel, try these troubleshooting steps:

- Make sure you've completely extracted the zip file
- Check that the files are in the correct Extensions directory
- Restart Bitwig Studio
- Check the controller setup in Bitwig's settings

## Folder Structure

BitwigBuddy uses several folders for different purposes:

- **Custom Presets**: Store your own pattern presets as .txt files
- **Macros**: Contains macro script files
- **Presets**: Built-in pattern presets

All these folders are located within the BitwigBuddy folder in your Extensions directory.
