## System Requirements

## ⚙️ Installation Steps

2. 📂 Extract the zip to the **_/Bitwig Studio/Extensions/_** folder. Be sure to extract the BitwigBuddy subfolder as well. It contains sample custom presets as txt files.

3. 🟧 In Bitwig, go to **Settings > Controller > Add Extension > Centomila > BitwigBuddy**

4. 🎉 BitwigBuddy should now appear in the Bitwig Studio Controller section

## Verifying Installation

After installation:

1. A BitwigBuddy panel should be available in Bitwig Studio
2. You'll see the Generate/Edit/Macro mode selector
3. The preset browser should display all available patterns

If you don't see the panel, try these troubleshooting steps:

- Make sure you've completely extracted the zip file
- Check that the files are in the correct Extensions directory
- Restart Bitwig Studio
- Check the controller setup in Bitwig's settings

## Folder Structure

BitwigBuddy uses several folders for different purposes:

- **Custom Presets**: Store your own pattern presets as .txt files
- **Macros**: Contains macro script files
- **Presets**: Built-in pattern presets

All these folders are located within the BitwigBuddy folder in your Extensions directory.
