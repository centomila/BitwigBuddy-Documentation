# Getting Started

Welcome to the getting started guide for our project. This page will walk you through the basics of setting up and using our project.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v14 or newer)
- npm or yarn

## Quick Start

The fastest way to get started is to use our CLI tool:

```bash
# Install the CLI tool
npm install -g our-project-cli

# Create a new project
our-project create my-awesome-app

# Navigate to the new project
cd my-awesome-app

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

After running these commands, you'll have a basic project running at `http://localhost:3000`.
