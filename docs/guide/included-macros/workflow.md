# Workflow Utility Macros

Workflow Utility Macros in BitwigBuddy automate common production tasks to speed up your music-making process. These practical macros save time by handling repetitive operations that would normally require multiple manual steps.

## Available Workflow Utility Macros

| Macro Name                   | Description                                                         | Time Saved  |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| Create 8 Tracks              | Creates a standard project structure with color-coded, named tracks | ~2 minutes  |
| Color Tracks in Group        | Removes track colors in a group to inherit the group color          | ~1 minute   |
| Bounce In Place then Reverse | Automates the process of bouncing and reversing audio material      | ~45 seconds |

## Project Setup: Create 8 Tracks

This essential macro quickly sets up a standard project structure with color-coded, named tracks for different instrument categories. Perfect for starting new projects with a consistent layout.

```
Macro: "Create 8 Tracks"
Description: "Create eight tracks with colors: Drums, Bass, Bass 2, Pad, Keys, Lead, Arp, and Vocals."
Author: "Centomila"

// Track 1: Drums (Red)
Create Instrument Track
Track Color ("D32F2F")
Track Rename ("Drums")

// Track 2: Bass (Green)
Create Instrument Track
Track Color ("43A047")
Track Rename ("Bass")

// Track 3: Bass 2 (Teal)
Create Instrument Track
Track Color ("00897B")
Track Rename ("Bass 2")

// Track 4: Pad (Violet)
Create Instrument Track
Track Color ("7B1FA2")
Track Rename ("Pad")

// Track 5: Keys (Yellow)
Create Instrument Track
Track Color ("F9A825")
Track Rename ("Keys")

// Track 6: Lead (Cyan)
Create Instrument Track
Track Color ("00ACC1")
Track Rename ("Lead")

// Track 7: Arp (Fuchsia)
Create Instrument Track
Track Color ("C2185B")
Track Rename ("Arp")

// Track 8: Vocals (Pink)
Create Audio Track
Track Color ("EC407A")
Track Rename ("Vocals")

Track Select (1)
```

## Track Organization: Color Tracks in Group

This utility macro makes it easy to visually organize tracks within a group by removing individual track colors, allowing them to inherit the group color. This creates a cohesive visual organization of your project.

```
Macro: "Color Tracks in Group"
Description: "Remove the color of all tracks in a group and inherit the color of the group track."
Author: "Centomila"

// Close the BitwigBuddy Panel
BB Close Panel
// Enter the selected group track
Enter Group

// Assign color (0) to the group track. 0 means no color
Track Color All (0)
Wait (100)
Track Select (1)

// Wait 100 ms to ensure the color is applied
Wait (100)

// Exit the group track
Exit Group

// Go back to the group track
Track Previous
```

## Audio Processing: Bounce In Place then Reverse

This clever macro automates a common sound design technique: bouncing a selection in place and then reversing it. It handles the entire process including positioning the reversed audio.

```
Macro: "Bounce In Place then Reverse"
Description: "Bounce in place the Time Selection and reverse it 1 bar earlier."
Author: "Centomila"

BB Arranger Mode
BB Close Panel
select_time_selection_tool
bounce_in_place
Wait (500)

switch_between_event_and_time_selection
select_object_selection_tool
reverse
Wait (100)

Clip Move (-4)
Wait (100)

Right
Wait (100)

Clip Move (-4)

## When to Use Workflow Utility Macros

These workflow utilities are most valuable when:

1. **Starting New Projects**: Use "Create 8 Tracks" to quickly set up a standardized project structure
2. **Organizing Complex Projects**: Use "Color Tracks in Group" to create visual clarity in projects with many tracks
3. **Sound Design Sessions**: Use "Bounce In Place then Reverse" to quickly experiment with reversed audio without breaking your creative flow

## Creating Your Own Workflow Utilities

These macros demonstrate how BitwigBuddy can automate your most common tasks. When creating your own workflow utilities, focus on:

1. **Repetitive Tasks**: Identify operations you perform repeatedly in every project
2. **Multi-Step Processes**: Look for processes that require several steps but could be condensed into one action
3. **Project Standards**: Consider how you can enforce consistent project organization
4. **Sound Design Techniques**: Automate your favorite sound manipulation techniques

By creating your own workflow utility macros, you can significantly speed up your production process and maintain consistency across projects.
