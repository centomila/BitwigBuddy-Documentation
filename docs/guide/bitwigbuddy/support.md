## Getting Help

Hey there! If you're running into issues or just have questions about BitwigBuddy, I've got you covered:

### GitHub Repository

The [BitwigBuddy GitHub Repository](https://github.com/centomila/BeatBuddy-Bitwig-Extension-MIDI-Drum-Generator) is where all the magic happens:

- Found a bug? Let me know so I can squash it!
- Have a cool feature idea? I'm all ears
- Want to contribute code? Please do (seriously, help me)
- Need docs? You're literally reading them right now

### Documentation

This documentation site has all the details about:
- [Installation](/guide/bitwigbuddy/installation)
- [Generate Mode](/guide/bitwigbuddy/generate-mode) 
- [Edit Mode](/guide/bitwigbuddy/edit-mode)
- [Macro Mode](/guide/bitwigbuddy/macro-mode)
- [Available Actions](/guide/bitwigbuddy-actions)

## Supporting BitwigBuddy

So here's the deal - I started making BitwigBuddy for myself just for fun. Then I thought, "Why not share it?" And here we are!

Let me be clear: BitwigBuddy is and always will be free. I make these tools because I enjoy it, and sharing them with you all makes it even better.

### Patreon

I've set up a [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/centomila), and honestly, if number goes up, monkey brain is happy! It's that simple. 

Your support helps me with:

- Building new cool features when I should probably be sleeping
- Fixing bugs (which I definitely didn't introduce myself...)
- Writing documentation that hopefully makes sense
- Answering the same questions in the community (with a smile!)

### GitHub Stars

Clicking that star button on [my GitHub repo](https://github.com/centomila/BeatBuddy-Bitwig-Extension-MIDI-Drum-Generator) costs you nothing but means a lot to me! It helps:

- Make more people discover the project
- Make me feel warm and fuzzy inside
- Trick other developers into thinking I know what I'm doing

### Share Your Creations

Made something cool with BitwigBuddy? Show it off! Nothing makes my day more than seeing what you create with these tools:

- Make YouTube tutorials (so I don't have to)
- Share on social media with #BitwigBuddy (I need content for my ego searches)
- Create pattern presets or macros
