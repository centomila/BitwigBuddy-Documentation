### üéµ Presets

BitwigBuddy comes with numerous predefined rhythmic and melodic presets for quick pattern generation.

#### Preset Mode Panels
![alt text](GenerateEditMacro.png)
- **Generate/Edit/Macro Mode:** Set this to "Generate" to create patterns.
- **Destination:**
  - **Launcher:** Generated pattern is placed in the Clip Launcher view.
  - **Arranger:** Generated pattern is placed on the arranger timeline.
- **Preset/Program:** Set this to "Preset" to select from predefined patterns.
- **Replace/Add Pattern:**
  - **Replace:** Overwrites existing notes completely.
  - **Add:** Adds generated pattern to existing notes.
- **Reverse Pattern:**
  - **Normal:** Plays pattern as saved.
  - **Reverse:** Plays pattern in reverse order.

### üõ†Ô∏è Creating Customized Presets

Save custom presets as `.txt` files in the `BitwigBuddy/Custom Presets` folder. Presets follow this syntax:

```
# Custom Preset Example
Preset Name: MyCustomPreset
Steps: 80,0,80,0,80,0,80,0
DefaultNote: "C#1"
Note Channel: 1
Step Size: 1/16
Subdivisions: Straight
Note Length: 1/16
```

#### Preset File Settings Explained:
- **Preset Name:** Display name in BitwigBuddy.
- **Steps:** Comma-separated velocities (0-127), 0 = no note.
- **DefaultNote:** Sets default MIDI note and octave (e.g., "C#1").
- **Note Channel:** MIDI channel for generated notes.
- **Step Size:** Rhythmic value of each step.
- **Subdivisions:** Rhythm subdivisions (Straight, Triplets, Quintuplets).
- **Note Length:** Length of each generated note.

#### Tips & Ideas
- Rapidly browse presets for quick inspiration.
- Reverse patterns for creative rhythmic results.
- Save your favorite patterns for easy recall.

## üé≤ Generate - Program Mode

#### Program Mode Panels
- **Pattern Type:** Select "Program" for semi-random patterns.
- **Steps:** Shows the generated step sequence.
- **Velocity Range:**
  - **Min Velocity:** Minimum note velocity.
  - **Max Velocity:** Maximum note velocity.
- **Velocity Shape:** Distribution method (Random, Linear, Curve).
- **Density:** Frequency of notes occurrence (0% to 100%).
- **Step Quantity:** Number of generated steps.
- **Skip Step:** Skip steps systematically:
  - Example: Density 100%, Skip Step at 1 ‚Üí Skips all odd-numbered steps.
  - Example: Density 100%, Skip Step at 2 ‚Üí skips even steps, focusing on odd steps.

#### Tips & Ideas
- Adjust density to quickly vary patterns.
- Experiment with velocity shapes to enhance groove.
- Use Skip Step creatively for unique rhythmic variations.

## ‚úèÔ∏è Edit Mode

#### Edit Panels Explained

- **Update Selected Steps Velocity:** Modify velocity of highlighted notes.
- **Velocity Range:** Set the velocity limits (min/max).
- **Velocity Shape:** Choose distribution shape (Random, Linear).
- **Clear Current Clip/Note Destination:** Clear the selected pattern or MIDI assignment.

#### Tips & Ideas
- Quickly humanize existing MIDI patterns.
- Use Edit Mode for detailed pattern refinement.

## ‚ö° Macro Mode

### üéº What is a Macro?

Macros in BitwigBuddy automate sequences of native Bitwig actions combined with custom commands, streamlining complex or repetitive tasks. Bitwig Actions correspond almost entirely to the list of Bitwig keyboard shortcut commands, including the not mapped ones.

#### Macro Panels


##### Macro 1-4

Macros stored in the `BitwigBuddy/Macros` folder.

![alt text](Images/Macro1.png)

- **Show Slots** Change slot view, switch to Instant Macro mode or hybrid mode.
- **Select Macro 1** Choose macro sequences to execute.
- **Open Macro 1 File** Open the selected macro file in the default text editor.
  - You can edit your file and save it to apply changes. No need to restart BitwigBuddy.
- **Macro 1 Description** Display the description of the selected macro.
- **Macro 1 Author** Display the author of the selected macro.
- **Execute Macro 1** Execute the selected macro.
- **Stop All Macros** Stop the execution of all macros.


##### Instant Macro

Define up to 8 quick-execute actions.

- **Instant Macro:** Define up to 8 quick-execute actions.
- 

#### Preset Folder

Store macros as `.txt` files in the `BitwigBuddy/Macros` folder. You can also use subfolders for organization.

#### Macro Syntax

Macros are written as commands, each line is an action. Commands include all Bitwig Actions and additional functions specifically made for this mode.

Notes:
- Commands are case-sensitive.
- Many additional commands require parameters in parentheses.
  - Parameters can be "Strings", Int (-1, 0, 1, 2, 3 etc), Float (-2.5, 0.0, 1.2, 420.42 etc), or Boolean (true/false).
- Some actions require the correct Bitwig view to be in focus (For example "Select All" has a different effect in the Arranger and Clip Launcher).
  - To automatically close the BitwigBuddy Panel, launch the command "Full screen". You can also send it two times to go back to the previous window mode.

Every Macro starts with some meta tags that define the name and description of the macro. These are not commands and are used to identify the macro in the list.

```MyMacro.txt
Macro: "Macro Name"
Description: "Macro Description/Instruction/Notes"
Author: "Author Name"
```

#### Variables and Loops

BitwigBuddy macros support variables and loops for more advanced automation:

##### Variables

Variables can be defined and used throughout your macro:

```
var clipLength = 4
var trackName = "Drums"
var basePosition = 2

// Use variables in commands with ${varName}
Clip Create(${basePosition}, ${clipLength})
Track Rename(${trackName})
```

##### For Loops

For loops allow you to repeat commands with an incrementing counter:

```
// Basic for loop syntax
for (i = 1 to 4) {
    Clip Create(${i}, 4)
    Clip Color(#FF0000)
}
```

The loop above will create 4 clips in positions 1, 2, 3, and 4, all with length 4 and colored red.

##### Math Expressions

You can perform calculations within variable references using standard math operators:

```
var baseLength = 2

// Create clips with increasing lengths
for (i = 1 to 8) {
    // Create clip where position = i, length = i * baseLength
    Clip Create(${i}, ${i*baseLength})
}
```

Supported operators: 
- Addition: `+`  
- Subtraction: `-`
- Multiplication: `*`
- Division: `/`

The result will be automatically rounded to integers when needed by commands.

##### Nested Loops

Loops can be nested for more complex patterns:

```
// Create a drum grid across multiple tracks and positions
var baseNote = 36
for (track = 1 to 4) {
    Track Select(${track})
    for (pos = 1 to 8) {
        Clip Create(${pos}, 1)
        Step Selected Velocity(${80 + track*10})
        Step Selected Note(${baseNote + track*4})
    }
}
```

##### Tips for Working with Loops

1. Make sure opening `{` and closing `}` braces are properly matched
2. Variables defined outside loops are accessible inside loops
3. Loop counter variables (like `i` in the examples) are only valid inside the loop
4. Use debug mode for troubleshooting: `BB Macro(myMacro, debug)`
5. You can use comments (`//`) both inside and outside loops, they will be ignored during execution

```
// Example with comments
var baseNote = 36

// This is a loop with comments inside
for (i = 1 to 4) {
    // This comment inside the loop is ignored
    Clip Create(${i}, 4)
}
```
